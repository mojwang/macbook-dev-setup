# Claude Global Config v2.0

## Core Principles
- Be direct and concise
- Test-driven development by default
- Security-first approach
- Match existing project patterns

## Git Workflow
- Feature branches only
- Small commits (<200 LOC diffs)
- Conventional commit format
- Create PR unless told otherwise

## Development Standards
- Fail-fast: `set -e` in shell scripts
- Clean up after interruptions
- Backup before system changes
- Follow project conventions

## Behavior
- Do only what's asked
- Prefer editing over creating files
- Never create docs unless requested
- Ask for clarification when blocked

## Important
When global CLAUDE.md updates, sync to macbook-dev-setup project.
