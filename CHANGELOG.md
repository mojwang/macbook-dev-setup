### BREAKING CHANGES

* Command-line interface completely redesigned

Simplified command structure:
- Reduced from 16+ complex flags to just 5 simple commands
- `./setup.sh` - Smart setup that auto-detects fresh vs update
- `./setup.sh preview` - Show what would be done (replaces --dry-run)
- `./setup.sh minimal` - Essential tools only
- `./setup.sh fix` - Run diagnostics
- `./setup.sh warp` - Warp terminal optimizations

Power user features:
- Environment variables for advanced options (SETUP_VERBOSE, SETUP_JOBS, etc)
- `./setup.sh advanced` - Interactive menu for all options
- Backwards compatible through env vars

Automatic Warp Terminal detection:
- Detects Warp Terminal installation/usage automatically
- Offers non-intrusive optimizations with user consent
- Installs delta for enhanced git diffs by default
- Optional power tools (atuin, mcfly, direnv, navi) with explanations
- Creates Warp workflows for common development tasks
- Configures shell specifically for Warp's features

Safety improvements:
- Only installs safe, non-intrusive tools by default
- Asks permission before making changes
- Preserves existing configurations
- Can be disabled with SETUP_NO_WARP=true

This change makes the setup much more user-friendly while maintaining
all power features for those who need them. 80% of users now just
run ./setup.sh with no flags needed.
